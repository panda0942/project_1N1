                    <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production
                         and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic
                          design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and
                           proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. 
                           Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, 
                           although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe
                            the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. 
                            Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. 
                        Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

              <h3>History</h3>
              <hr>

              <p> 1988â€“2001</p>

                Although web design has a fairly recent history,
                 it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design, 
                 user experience, and multimedia arts, but is more aptly seen
                  from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of people's
                   everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, 
                   different styles of typography, background, videos and music. The web was announced on
                    August 6, 1991; in November 1992, CERN was the first website to go live on the World Wide Web. 
                    During this period, websites were structured by using the <table> tag which created numbers on the website.
                         Eventually, web designers were able to find their way around it to create more structures and format. 
                         In early history, the structure of the websites was fragile and hard to contain, so it became very difficult to
                     use them. In November 1993,
                      ALIWEB was the first ever search engine to be created (Archie Like Indexing for the WEB).[2]</p>

                <h3>The start of the web and web design</h3>
                <p>
In 1989, whilst working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee proposed
 to create a global hypertext project, which later became known
  as the World Wide Web. From 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born.
   Text-only HTML pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode web browser.[3]
    In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were
     multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text-heavy. 
     There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The 
     Mosaic browser broke this mould.[4] The W3C was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to
      its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."[5] T
      his discouraged any one company from monopolizing a proprietary browser and programming language, which could have 
      altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with 
      JavaScript and other languages. In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape 
      Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. 
      For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. From 1996
       to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many
        new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML.
 On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.[6]
