            <hr>
			<h1>Christianity</h1>
			<p>
				The Christian understanding is that love comes from God, who is himself love (1 John 4:8).
                 The love of man and woman—eros in Greek—and the unselfish love of others (agape), are often 
                 contrasted as "descending" and "ascending" love, respectively, but are ultimately the same thing.[45]
                There are several Greek words for "love" that are regularly referred to in Christian circles.
			</p>
            <h4>phileo</h4>
			<p>Also used in the New Testament, phileo is a human response to 
                something that is found to be delightful. Also known as "brotherly love." -->
            Two other words for love in the Greek language, eros (sexual love) 
            and storge (child-to-parent love), were never used in the New Testament.[9]
              Christians believe that to love God with all your heart, mind, and strength and
             love your neighbor as yourself are the two most important things in life 
             (the greatest commandment of the Jewish Torah, according to Jesus; cf. Gospel of Mark 12:28–34).
              Saint Augustine summarized this when he wrote "Love God, and do as thou wilt."[46]
                The Apostle Paul glorified love as the most important virtue of all. Describing love in the 
            famous poetic interpretation in 1 Corinthians, he wrote, "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres." (1 Corinthians 13:4–7)
			</p>
			<p>
                <a class="john"> The Apostle John wrote,</a> "For God so loved the world that he
                 gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall
                  not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into
                   the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him." 
                   (John 3:16–17) John also wrote, "Dear friends, let us love one another for love
                    comes from God. Everyone who loves has been 
                born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love." (1 John 4:7–8)

                <a class="saint">Saint Augustine</a>
				wrote that one must be able to decipher the difference between love and lust. 
                Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life.
                 He even says, "I was in love with love."[citation needed] Finally, he does fall in love and is 
                 loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God,
                  because love with a human only allows for flaws such as "jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and 
                  contention."[47]: III.1  According to Saint Augustine, to love God is "to attain the peace which is yours."[47]: X.27 
                Augustine regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as
                 the heart of Christian faith and the interpretation of the Bible. 
                 After the review of Christian doctrine, Augustine treats the problem
                  of love in terms of use and enjoyment until the end of Book I of De Doctrina Christiana (1.22.21–1.40.44).[48]
			</p>
			<p>Christian theologians see God as the source of love,
                 which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships.
                  Influential Christian theologian C. S. Lewis wrote a book called The Four Loves.
                   Benedict XVI named his first encyclical God is love. He said that a human being, created in 
                   the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others (agape) 
                   and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him,
                    is the life of the saints such as Teresa of Calcutta and Mary, 
                the mother of Jesus and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.[45]
			</p>
			<p>
                <a class="poe"> Pope Francis </a>
               asserts that the "Cross (Jesus crucified) is the greatest meaning of the greatest love,"[49] 
                and in the crucifixion is found everything, all knowledge and the entirety of God's love.[50] Pope Francis
                 taught that "True love is both loving and letting oneself be loved... 
                what is important in love is not our loving, but allowing ourselves to be loved by God.
                "[51] And so, in the analysis of a Catholic theologian, for Pope Francis, "the key to love... is not our activity.
                 It is the activity of the greatest, and the source, of all the powers in the universe: God's."[52] 
                 In Christianity the practical definition of love is summarised by Thomas Aquinas, who defined love as 
                 "to will the good of another," or to desire for another to succeed.[13] This is an explanation of the
                  Christian need to love others, including their enemies. Thomas Aquinas explains that Christian love is 
                  motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people.
